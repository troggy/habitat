# Development

Use `docker-compose up --exit-code-from dev` to bootstrap the environment.
Enter the development container with `docker-compose run dev sh`, the root folder is mounted at `/app`.

Additionally, use `docker-compose run -p 8111:8111 dev sh` to establish a port mapping.

Then change the directory inside the container `cd /app` and run `node receipts/simple.js` for a simple bootstrap environment.

Note: You may need to run `yarn compile` first.

That provides you with a full stack environment in combination with `receipts/simple.js`.

### Compiling Contracts

Run `yarn compile` inside the docker container.

After compiling contract run `mv scripts/GovernanceToken.json build/contracts`.

### UI

A local http server at `scripts/http.js` is available to host the web ui at `web/`.

The Web UI is available at `http://localhost:8080/`.

### Tests

Run the tests with `yarn test`.
You can run single/multiple tests only with `yarn _test path/to/file(s)`.
